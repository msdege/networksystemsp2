I implemented a base Socket for a Transmission Control Protocol state machine to allow Java applications to open and close and send packets from client to server.
This implementation of a socket is able to tolerate packet loss of up to 20%.

Here is a diagram depicting the different states from when the machine is first executed to the final closing of the machine:
